Hey, I’m **Sonajit**.

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate learning cybersecurity, mostly by spending time in labs, breaking things, and figuring out why they break. This blog is where I keep my notes and writeups so I don’t forget what I’ve learned.

## What I’m Into

Right now, I’m mostly focused on:

- TryHackMe rooms and CTF-style challenges  
- Cryptography concepts and common mistakes  
- Linux systems and basic networking  
- Understanding how attacks work at a low level  

I’m more interested in learning properly than rushing through things.

## About This Blog

Most posts here come from things I’m actively working on. If I solve a lab, experiment with something, or finally understand a concept, I usually write it down here.

Some posts are detailed, some are short, and some are just notes. The goal is simple: keep things clear and useful.
