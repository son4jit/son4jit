## Overview

Cybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing and most in-demand technology careers today. From protecting personal data to defending organizations against large-scale cyberattacks, cybersecurity professionals play a critical role in the digital world.

If you’re a beginner wondering how to start a career in cybersecurity, this guide provides a **clear, practical roadmap**—from building fundamentals to hands-on practice, certifications, and community involvement.

## Why Cybersecurity?

Every organization today—whether a bank, university, or startup—relies on technology. With this dependence comes the constant threat of cyberattacks. That’s why cybersecurity professionals are needed everywhere.

Beyond job demand, the field offers variety. You can explore areas like ethical hacking, digital forensics, SOC operations, OSINT, malware analysis, and more.

## Step 1: Build a Strong Foundation

Before diving into hacking tools and advanced techniques, get comfortable with the basics:

- **Computer Networks** – TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls, VPNs  
- **Operating Systems** – Linux and Windows administration  
- **Programming & Scripting** – Python, Bash, C/C++ for automation and analysis  

---

## Step 2: Learn Security Fundamentals

Once you have the basics, start focusing on core cybersecurity concepts:

- Cryptography  
- Web application security  
- Common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows)  
- Security policies and risk management  

A must-read resource is the **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)**.
